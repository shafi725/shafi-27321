The Employee Performance Management System is a PL/SQL-based application that assesses, calculates, and grades an employee's performance based on structured data and automated logic. It collects information on employees, processes the categories in performance reviews, applies weighted scores, identifies areas of low performance, and generates a comprehensive report on performance.

This system is based on records, collections, loops, conditional statements, and GOTO labels; it introduces advanced features of PL/SQL while simulating a real process of organizational performance evaluation.

It calculates the total and weighted scores, pinpoints weak categories, determines the performance level of an employee, such as Exceptional, Meets Expectations, and Needs Improvement, and gives recommendations including promotion eligibility, training needs, and performance improvement plans.

The project, through the use of PL/SQL, provides automation in HR functions so as to report analytical performance for better management of employees and decision-making.
